Culling growth
    In crowded environments, bacteria often stop growing and dividing 
    due to physical constraints or the depletion of nutrients.
    This state is called Stationary Phase.
Biofilm formation
    Bacteria form cooperative or competitive relationships with 
    each other.
Quorum sensing
    Bacteria detect their surroundings and if overcrowded can 
    produce bacreriocins to eliminate competition.
Physical adaptation
    If unable to complete a binary fission they can elongate and wait 
    for a more suitable condition to split.
Stress response
    Bacteria can go into a dormant state when the surrounding environment
    is unfavourable and reawaken at a later time.
Spore formation:
    Bacteria form endospores, which are a kind of structure that
    protects them until they can grow and split again.
