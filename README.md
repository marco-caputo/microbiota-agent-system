# Microbiota Agent System

## Overview  
This project is a **Multi-Agent System (MAS) simulation** designed to model **gut-brain interactions**, specifically focusing on the **influence of sugar intake on neurotransmitter production**. The simulation aims to provide insights into how dietary sugars impact microbial populations and their effects on neurochemical signaling.  

## Running the Simulation  
To run the simulation, execute the following command in the project directory:  
```bash
python main.py setup.yaml
```
This will initialize and execute the simulation using the configuration specified in `setup.yaml`.  

## Configuration  
The simulation parameters are defined in the `setup.yaml` file. You can modify these parameters to adjust the behavior of the system. Each parameter is documented with comments in the file to explain its purpose and effect on the simulation.  

## License  
This project is open-source. Feel free to use, modify, and contribute.
